My project is a project to download a programming book, manage users(update, delete), books(create a new book, delete, and update), it's an application web with java/j2ee(framwork SpringBoot as a backend, and framwork thymeleaf
as a frontend), I use spring data and spring security for the authentification like create a new account and sign in.
